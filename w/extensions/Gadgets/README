The Gadgets extension provides a way for wiki_users to pick JavaScript or CSS
based "gadgets" that other wiki wiki_users provide.

<https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets>

The Gadgets extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in 2007
and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).
The internationalization files may contain contributions by several people;
they should be mentioned in each file individually.

== Prerequisites ==
This version of Gadgets requires MediaWiki 1.19 or later. To get a version
compatible with earlier MediaWiki release, visit
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/Gadgets

== Installing ==
Copy the Gadgets directory into the extensions folder of your
MediaWiki installation. Then add the following lines to your
LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

  require_once( "$IP/extensions/Gadgets/Gadgets.php" );

== Usage ==
See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets#Usage

== Caveats ==

* Gadgets do not apply to Special:Preferences, Special:wiki_userLogin and
  Special:ResetPass so wiki_users can always disable any broken gadgets they
  may have enabled, and malicious gadgets will be unable to steal passwords.
* Uses BeforePageDisplay hook, thus only works with MonoBook based skins;
  specifically, does not work with CologneBlue.
* Gadget code is included after wiki_user code - that means that wiki_user JS has no
  access to things defined in gadgets, and wiki_user CSS is overwritten by CSS
  from gadgets. (pending a better way to insert things into the HTML head)
